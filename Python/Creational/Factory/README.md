## Factory 
- Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- The factory method centralizes object creation and tracking your objects becomes much easier.
- introducing changes to the function is easy and does not require any changes to the code that uses it.
